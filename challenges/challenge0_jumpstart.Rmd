## Content

This challenge is about time series forecasting.  

The purpose of this challenge is to apply the methods you know by now 
to produce the most accurate forecast for a single time series.



## Requirements

You are required to produce a fully reproducible notebook report explaining 
all the steps to forecast and their evaluation.    

You have to apply your methods on the train set, forecast 8 weeks ahead and 
evaluate on the test set.  

You have to evaluate your methods with RMSE.   

You are free to apply any method and software you like (even MS Excel).  



## Data

Challenge dataset contains daily time series of email subscribers volume (in log).

```{r data, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
readr::read_csv("../data/challenges/challenge0.csv", show_col_types = FALSE) |> 
  timetk::plot_time_series(ds, y, .color_var = type, .smooth = FALSE)
```

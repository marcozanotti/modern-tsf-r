## Content

This challenge is about hyperparameter tuning (Module 2 Lecture 2.3).  

The purpose of this challenge is to test your ability to optimize sequential and
non-sequential models for time series forecasting.  



## Requirements

You are required to produce a fully reproducible notebook report explaining 
all the steps that takes you towards the optimization of a sequential model and
a non-sequential model.  

You are free to apply the feature sets you created during Challenge 1.   



## Data

Challenge dataset contains an hourly time series of the M4 competition.

```{r data, echo=FALSE}
readr::read_csv("../data/challenges/challenge1.csv", show_col_types = FALSE) |> 
  timetk::plot_time_series(ds, y, .smooth = FALSE)
```

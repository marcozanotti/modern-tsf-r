## Content

This challenge is about the use of modeltime R package (Module 1, Lecture 1.3).  

The purpose of this challenge is to apply the modeltime workflow to one or
more time series of the challenge.   



## Requirements

You are required to produce a fully reproducible notebook report explaining 
all the steps to forecast with Prophet, Random Forest and SVM algorithms.  

You are free to apply the feature sets you created during Challenge 1.  



## Data

Challenge dataset contains an hourly time series of the M4 competition.

```{r data, echo=FALSE}
readr::read_csv("../data/challenges/challenge1.csv", show_col_types = FALSE) |> 
  timetk::plot_time_series(ds, y, .smooth = FALSE)
```
